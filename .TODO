# Minor (potentially only Development) Bug: When logging in and being forwarded to Home the selected_language is not reflected in menu and header locales until pressing F5 despite src/utils/localeConfiguration.ts returning correct locale. To reproduce, change e.g. a value in resource properties after logging out, then login and the language discrepancy can be seen, if the locale is set to german. Since some values then use the default fallback of english. It seems the file is not queried for the menu and header values and some others. In http://localhost:3001/fiscalismia/deals/food_prices some values like the dropdown text on the right are in german, while the buttons are in english. I suspect a HMR caching issue with local development. ====> Test in production with a compiled javascript file, I suspect it might be gone.
