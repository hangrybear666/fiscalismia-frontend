# TODO List for [Fiscalismia Frontend]

## BUGS
- Wenn man F5 zum Reload drückt ist Home in Headerzeile gerendered, statt der eigentlichen Navigation
- Pressing Raw Data in Variable Expenses gets stale state from year prior only on year selection, not on month selection

- income/monthly_budget Feinschliff verpassen -> x Achse als Zeit-Achse und kürzere Linie nach rechts auffüllen
- fix menu breakpoints. menu pops up on very small width. the menu expansion icon doesnt work in between

- Minor (potentially only Development) Bug: When logging in and being forwarded to Home the selected_language is not reflected in menu and header locales until pressing F5 despite src/utils/localeConfiguration.ts returning correct locale. To reproduce, change e.g. a value in resource properties after logging out, then login and the language discrepancy can be seen, if the locale is set to german. Since some values then use the default fallback of english. It seems the file is not queried for the menu and header values and some others. In http://localhost:3001/fiscalismia/deals/food_prices some values like the dropdown text on the right are in german, while the buttons are in english. I suspect a HMR caching issue with local development. ====> Test in production with a compiled javascript file, I suspect it might be gone.

## Additional Development

- Make Investment and Dividend Table and deals/overview Table have copy pastable cells
- Add Delete Button without ruining style in deals/grocery_deals for food_item_discount
- remove the vertical red bar and golden vertical box in overview var expenses when selecting "All" as month
- add the navigational arrows from variable expenses overview to Income (3x) and Fixed Costs (2x)
- make stock selling use ISIN dropdown to select only existing stock and pre-populate in all known values
- selling stock should throw an error if selling stock not owned in adequate amount. either SQL or frontend calculation like in dividends and taxes
- Persist new added var expenses in db and refresh overview of variable expenses and continue work on MODAL with input validation and so forth
